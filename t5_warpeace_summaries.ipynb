But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.” It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna Schérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pávlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite. All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows: “If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette Schérer.” “Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa. “First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s mind at rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned. “Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?” said Anna Pávlovna. “You are staying the whole evening, I hope?” “And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,” said the prince. “My daughter is coming for me to take me there.” “I thought today’s fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.” “If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,” said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed. “Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.” “What can one say about it?” replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. “What</td>\n",

      " prince andrew's advice: never marry until you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of. if you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, all that is good and noble in you will be lost. prince andrew's advice: never marry until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is. prince andrew said his wife is an excellent woman, but o god, what would he not give now to be unmarried. pierre considered his friend a model of perfection because he possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities pierre admired. pierre was struck by prince andrew's lack of capacity for philosophical meditation. he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength. prince andrew's son anatole was planning to reform by marrying him to his sister. pierre had promised anatole kuragin not to go to his gathering. kuragin was a notorious gambler and duelist who lived with anatole. kuragin's spokesman said he was 'disappointed' by pierre's decision. pierre dólokhov bet with stevens that he would drink a bottle of rum. dólokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. dólokhov could play all games and nearly always won. dólokhov bets he will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from his mouth. if anyone else does the same, he will pay him a hundred imperials, anatole says. dólokhov jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs. dólokhov had stooped to pick up some broken glass. pierre hid his face from which a faint smile forgot to fade. dólokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown further back. x prince vasili kept promise he had given to princess drubetskaya on behalf of her son boris. boris transferred into the regiment of semenov guards with the rank of cornet. anna mikhaylovna returned to moscow and went straight to her rich relations. countess apraksina was at the razumóvski’s ball on catherine’s day. she met count bezkhov's illegitimate son pierre, who had behaved so improperly at anna pavlovna’s reception. count bezkhov's illness and his son's vexation about his son is enough to kill him. prince vasili's son and a certain dólokhov have been sent back to moscow. anna mikhaylovna: \"his children are all illegitimate. i think pierre also is illegitimate\" prince vasili is the next heir through his wife, but the count is very fond of pierre . \n",

      " prince vasili arrived in moscow yesterday to see count cyril vladimirovich. princess ilya, 13, ran to hide something in the folds of her short muslin frock. the count threw his arms round the girl who had run in. boris and nicholas mikhaylovna were friends from childhood. nicholas was the undergraduate, the count’s eldest son, and sónya, the count’s fifteen-year-old niece. boris was tall and fair; his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate features. nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression. nicholas and sónya were the only young people remaining in the drawing room. sónya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes. sónya was a slender little kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat. julie karagina: \"what a pity you weren't at the arkharovs' on thursday. it was so dull without you\" \"cousinage—dangereux voisinage,\" said anna mikhaylovna. \"i know i shall always be my daughters' first confidante,\" said the countess. countess vera was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at learning, and had a pleasant voice. \"people are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them,\" said the countess. natasha jumped up onto a tub to be higher than boris, and kissed him full on the lips. boris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not reply. \"i don’t like you to talk like that,\" said natasha. princess anna mikhaylovna and her friend sónya and natasha sat in a room of their own. natasha and sónya smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt. anna mikhaylovna and natasha sat next to each other in the same room. countess anna mikhaylovna was left a widow without means and with a son. \"i often wonder at you, annette, how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to moscow, to petersburg, and know how to deal with them all!\" princess anna mikhaylovna has not seen prince vasili since we acted together at the rumyantsovs’ theatricals. if he does not assist his godson, bóry's life is only just beginning. count cyril vladimirovich bezkhov will leave something for his godson. if he will not assist his godson, bóry's life is only just beginning. prince vasili sergeevich is staying at the house of count cyril vladimirovich bezkhov. he is a relative of princess anna mikhaylovna, who is a relative of prince vasili. prince vasili is a relative of princess victoria bezkhov . \n",

      " the battle of borodinó was the first napoleon did not win. napoleon fulfilled his office as representative of authority as well as, and even better than, at other battles. napoleon commanded an army for three weeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments. napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that his order had been executed. napoleon: \"our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time.\" pierre ordered his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning. he fell asleep behind a partition in a corner boris had given up to him. \"hear the firing,\" said the groom, a discharged soldier. pierre kutzov admired the scene from a knoll in borodinó, smolensk. smoke clouds from the guns mingled with the mist, and over the whole expanse they spread. kutzov's troops were seen everywhere, in front and to the right and left. pierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets, and those sounds. he clambered onto a horse, seized it by the mane, and turned out his toes pressed his heels against its sides. kutzov's musketry was a great success, he says, and he is a great soldier. pierre rode into the middle of a battalion where soldiers were firing. he did not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side. a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay, with his head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off. pierre rode along the hollow with the adjutant to raevski's redoubt. he was wounded in the off foreleg above the knee. the battery was known to the russians as the knoll battery. pierre, a senior artillery officer, was politely greeted by the soldiers. a shell tore up the earth two paces from pierre and he looked around with a smile. he said: \"she has no mercy, you know! when she comes spluttering down, out go your innards\" merry voices and jokes were heard on all sides of the battlefield. \"they’ve withdrawn the front line, it has retired,\" said one soldier. \"oh, you crows! you’re scared!\" shouted one soldier. a cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork, a soldier, or a gun. pierre, who had not noticed these sounds before, was shouted at for being in the way. a cannon ball struck the very end of the earthwork by which he was standing, crumbling down the earth . \n",

      " napoleon's orders did not correspond to the course of events in the first case. but they did correspond in the latter case. napoleon's command can never be the cause of the event. jeffrey toobin: for common action people always unite in certain combinations. toobin: the larger number take a more direct share, and the smaller number a less direct share. he says a similar relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men. toobin: a similar relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men. a man who worked most with his hands could not think so much about what he was doing. he would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater verbal activity. when a man works alone he always has a set of reflections which justify his past activity. frida ghitis: how is it that millions of men commit collective crimes? ghitis: every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed wish. she says historians have assumed that the events depended on those commands. ghitis: if we look at historical people's wills, we will find that they were dependent on events. david rothkopf: history is a series of disconnected incidents. he says the problem of man’s free will is felt at every step of history. rothkopf: if in a thousand years even one man in a million could act as he pleased. the problem of free will is that regarding man as a subject of observation, we find a general law of necessity to which he (like all that exists) is subject. a man is only conscious of himself as a living being by the fact that he wills, that is, is conscious of his volition. but his will—which forms the essence of his life—man recognizes (and can but recognize) as free. samantha gupta: man is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing god. gupta: man's actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting upon him. gupta: a man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of life. naturalists say soul and freedom do not exist because man sprang from the apes. edward mccaffery: the naturalists are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls. he says if man descended from the apes at an unknown period of time, that is comprehensible. mccaffery: the naturalists and their followers, thinking they can solve this question, are like plasterers. history surveys a presentation of man’s life in which the union of these two contradictions has already taken place. a sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; a hungry mother exhausted by feeding her baby, who steals some food. a man trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless man. a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than one standing on dry ground. if we consider a man alone, apart from his relation to everything around him, each action of his seems to us free. a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than one standing on dry ground . \n",
